      <p style="color:white">
        The Rolex Submariner is the archetypal diver’s watch, a symbol of underwater discovery and conquest. First released in 1953, the original Submariner was waterproof to 330 feet – a record at its time. Thanks to its subtly redesigned Oyster case, more recent models are now waterproof up to 1,000 feet.
        Recognisable for its distinctive dial, the large luminescent hour markers align it to underwater conditions. With its graduated rotatable Cerachrom bezel and Oyster bracelet, the Submariner boasts an iconic design, making it one the most recognisable and desirable Rolex models to this day.

        Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour
        or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for
        each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.

        <br>The Rolex Oyster Perpetual is based on the 1926 Rolex Oyster, the first waterproof watch in the world. The simplest and purest of all Rolex watches, the Rolex Oyster Perpetual is designed for nothing less than the clear and precise display of time.
        The Oyster Perpetual is defined by two features: its aesthetics, and its self-winding Perpetual movement. The perpetual motion mechanism, designed by Rolex in 1931, provides the watch with a constant source of energy, without the need for winding. Its timeless design sets it apart as a true classic – for all time.
